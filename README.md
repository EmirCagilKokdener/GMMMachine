Some people (e.g. bodybuilders, athletes, dancers etc.) have different dietary needs, to provide
a convenient place for them to get their meals LiveLong Gym has decided to build a machine
(i.e. Gym Meal Machine (GMM)) that will allow them to choose their meals based on the
nutrients they want. With this machine members can freely choose their meals based on its
protein, carbohydrate, fat, or calorie content, and they can also choose a specific item with
its slot number.
In this experiment, you are expected to implement firmware of GMM using Object Oriented
Programing. There are two parts to this experiment, first GMM should be loaded with
meals/products, then it can take orders from members of the gym.
